Phaser: HTML5 game development framework for both desktop and mobile

THREE FILES THAT ARE REQUIRED IN PROJECT:
phaser.js: un-minified javascript phasor framework
phaser.map: intended to help mitigate warning msgs from browsers
phaser.min.js: minified framework, should use when distributing the project

Phasor can use either system or bitmap fonts to display dynamic text
- we need a .png containing all the font characters, then 
- .fnt that is an xml definition of where to find specific characters in the png

littera: suggested free software for converting fonts to bitmap fonts
- http://kvazars.com/littera

Phasor allows the use of multiple sound channels to be used at the same time
- i.e. background music and sound effects
- so we can deploy direct sound files into the project
